function IBM_Expand_VdiskSize {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Get back the cli-command to expand non-Hyperswap Volumes
    .DESCRIPTION
        With the help of this function, the powershell connects to the specified storage system and collects the names of all volumes or the volume names specified in the filter with a wildcard. 
        All unnecessary data will be removed and the command for volume expansion is listed in the prompt.

        You can expand the capacity of any volume in a Global Mirror or Metro Mirror relationship that is in a consistent_synchronized state.
        You must expand both volumes in a relationship to maintain full operation of the system. 
        To perform this task:
        1. Expand the secondary volume by the required extra capacity.
        2. Expand the primary volume by the required extra capacity.

        Volumes in Metro Mirror and Global Mirror relationships cannot be expanded if any of these conditions are true:
        - Volumes are in Global Mirror relationships that are operating in cycling mode.
        - Volumes are in relationships where a change volume is configured. The change volume must be removed from the relationship before the volume can be expanded.

        You cannot use the expandvdisksize command to expand HyperSwapÂ® volumes, instead use the expandvolume command.

        You cannot expand the capacity of any volume in a migration relationship.

        Only a user with the security administrator or the superuser role is permitted to use expandvdisksize to change the capacity of a Safeguarded backup copy.
